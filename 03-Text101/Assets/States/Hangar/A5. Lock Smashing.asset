  storyText: "Got to be something around here to help with some smashy smashy. You
    see a crate with all manner of pipes, wires and cogs scattered within it. Mostly
    trash.\r\n\r\nYou could try the brute force approach - wack the lock with one
    of the pipes. Or you could take some time to build a contraption with some kind
    of leverage, maybe a mini pulley system with those wires and the cogs.\r\n\r\nHow
    to proceed?\r\n1. No time to waste, grab the pipe, start wacking.\r\n2. Take the
    time to build a leverage-gadget."
