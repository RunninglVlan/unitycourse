## What's new
- [2D Sprite Shape](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.spriteshape@8.0) is a flexible and powerful world building Asset that features Sprite tiling along a shape's outline that automatically deforms and swaps Sprites based on the angle of the outline
  - Sprite Shapes comprise of two parts - the [Sprite Shape Profile](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.spriteshape@8.0/manual/SSProfile.html) Asset, and the [Sprite Shape Controller](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.spriteshape@8.0/manual/SSController.html) component.
  - Use _colliderOffset_ to resize the collider edges a bit
- There is an Asset Menu for creating _Dynamic Sprite_ which comes with Collider and RigidBody already added
