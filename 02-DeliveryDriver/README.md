Delivery Driver, 20 Lectures: [10](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/learn/lecture/28701056) - [29](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/learn/lecture/28701148)

## What's new
- Use [gravityScale](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D-gravityScale.html) to change how much gravity affects specific body, e.g., set it to 0 to disable gravity
- Use [spritePixelsPerUnit](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextureImporter-spritePixelsPerUnit.html) to change the size of the original sprite, scene instances can still be resized later
